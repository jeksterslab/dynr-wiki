This website serves as a Wiki for consolidating documentation, knowledge bases, and other relevant information pertaining to the `dynr` package. The intention is not to supplant existing sources of information, for example, [https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=dynr](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=dynr) and [https://github.com/mhunter1/dynr](https://github.com/mhunter1/dynr), but to supplement them.
