## Running the dynr Docker Container

-  Launch `Docker Desktop`.
-  Type the following to launch `Rstudio Server`[^dynr-rocker-mac-1] on your macOS terminal:

[^dynr-rocker-mac-1]: Note for developers only: Replace `jeksterslab/dynr-rocker` with `jeksterslab/dynr-arma-rocker` to use the `arma` branch.

```bash
docker run --rm -ti -e PASSWORD=yourpassword -p 127.0.0.1:8787:8787 jeksterslab/dynr-rocker
```

-  Open http://localhost:8787 on your web browser to launch `Rstudio Server`.
    -  username: rstudio
    -  password: yourpassword[^docker-mac-2]

[^docker-mac-2]: You can change the password by replacing `yourpassword` in `PASSWORD=yourpassword`.
