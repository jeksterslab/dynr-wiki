This website serves as a Wiki for consolidating documentation, knowledge
bases, and other relevant information pertaining to the `dynr` package.
The intention is not to supplant existing sources of information, for
example, <https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=dynr> and
<https://github.com/mhunter1/dynr>, but to supplement them.

## Website

The website is deployed in <https://jeksterslab.github.io/dynr-wiki>.
